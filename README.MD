# Serendipi-art? Really?
'Serendipi-art' originated from a lack of creative juice and is short for 'serendipitious art'. Serendipi-art determinstically generates a [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) image with a random caption by providing it with a seed value. The image is captioned using OpenAI's GPT-3 [davinci-instruct-beta-v3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/instruct-series-beta) model, with the caption randomly generated by giving the model the following prompt:

>This is an image name generator
>
>1. Colourful Shapes
>2. Light All Over
>3. Voronoi Masterpiece
>4. Lucid Dreams
>5. Naughty by Nature
>6. Bad and Beyond
>7. Rainbow Rain
>8.
As seen above, point 8 is left intentionally blank as that point will be autocompleted by OpenAI. Pretty cool.

We give OpenAI some examples of image names and it's able to complete our list with a name that could possibly fit in our list. For example, an OpenAI response could look like:
>8. **Ominous Fog**
